# CPM
CPM is a small tool I made in C to quickly make C/C++ projects. When given a project name, it'll automatically create a directory containing a main file, a header file and a makefile all populated with template code.
Also, the name is a shorthand for "C Project Maker". It might also be vulnerable to buffer overflows, so be careful I guess.

Feel free to laugh at my horrible C code.
